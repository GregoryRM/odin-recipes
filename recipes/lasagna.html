            My Journey to Flavour Town
        </h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Many years ago</strong>, when I was but a young duckling,
             my dearest Papa sent me to work in the lasanga mines. It was back
              breaking labour and many nights I would find myself coughing up 
              blood mixed with small lasagna particulates. The noxoius fumes from 
              the mines were so toxic and dangerous that most nights
              at least one of the many children on my line would sucumb to the gas.
              Some would collapse, only to be dragged out of the way for another
              to take their place. Often, those who fell would be left in the mines; 
              their bodies gone by the next day. The unending laberenth held many 
              dangers and of these dangers, the lasagna critters were the most 
              terrifing. Always heard, sometimes smelt, but never seen. 
              They were scavangers at best, often we would attribute the 
              dissapearances of our commrades corpses to the citters. At worst, they 
              would pick off those stupid enough to stray into the darkness 
              or those who doddled during shift change. I can still hear the screams.
