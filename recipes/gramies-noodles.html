                 Who is "Grammie" And What Are Her Noodles?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Back in 1942, when I was still in the gulag, I always dreamed of eating 
                something other than dirt. Infact, I always dreamed that one day a strong, 
                brutal, and insane 90 year old woman would float down from space and squish 
                Stalin's stupid head between her mighty thighs; most importantly she would 
                bring me a delicious noodle dish to snack on while she kicked Stalin's rotten 
                ass. She never did come, however this is what I imagine the noodles would have 
                tasted like.
